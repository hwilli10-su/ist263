        I loved The Bluest Eye and it may even be my favrite Toni Morrison piece to date. Her writing flows almost like poetry but without the prose, and the way she describes places and objects that are integral to the plot really puts a visceral image in the readers head. Very well done emotional plot.

        Jodi Picoult demonstrated her range as a writer in her book Small Great Things. The ability to write about a topic outside of her own experience and put herself in someone else's shoes is a hard thing to do well, but she managed to pull it off masterfully. A gut wrenching page turner I would highly recommend to anyone trying to understand race relations and the intracacies of interpersonal relationships.
