        My name is Hailey Williams and I’m a Communications Design major with an interest in UX design and web development as well as editorial design. My skills include product package design, UX design, editorial design, advertising, adobe illustrator, photoshop, XD, and InDesign, photography, art direction, brand development, and copywriting. I’m a VPA ambassador and work for the VPA recruitment office, I’m on the executive board of the Fashion and Design Society as head of hair and makeup, I’m an RA for the design Living Learning Community on campus, and I do editorial design and layouts for on campus magazines JERK and Mixtape. Previously I was also a peer mentor for VPA. Outside of these activities my hobbies include writing poetry, painting, drawing and film photography. I also love watching reality tv shows like Love Island, Married at First Sight, and 90 Day Fiancé, but my favorite show of all time is American Horror Story and I love true crime documentaries.
